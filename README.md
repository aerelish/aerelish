`Software Developer ( Backend + Frontend + DevOps )`

### I do software development. Fast, clean, and slightly(?) chaotic...

<p> With 3+ years of experience working on Fullstack Applications across multiple platforms, and 5+ years experience of programming across multiple programming languages. Most of my projects here are built from the ground up, from designing 😵‍💫 to deployment 🤯, I suffered from it all and yet here I am, working on another one... 🤦 </p>
